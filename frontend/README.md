This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js` or any other page in the `pages` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## To be noted

Components go into `/components`. You can create subfolders here if wanted. Use the `@components` shortcut for imports. Same applies to Â´/utils`.

Tailwdind CSS (including forms and headless UI) is already inclured. We changed the default config so that containers are always centered.
